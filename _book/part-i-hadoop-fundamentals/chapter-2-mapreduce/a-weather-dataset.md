# A Weather Dataset

For our example, we will write a program that mines weather data. Weather sensors collect data every hour at many locations across the globe and gather a large volume of log data, which is a good candidate for analysis with MapReduce because we want to process all the data, and the data is semi-structured and record-oriented.
